# Nativedex

Possibly Pokemon is one of the most recognized brands worldwide, it marked generations, and I am among them. I remember many days spent watching the animated series or playing their video games. As a child, I liked to fantasize that those monsters could materialize someday and thus become a Pokemon master.

I don't play them much anymore, but I remember with nostalgia the feeling. And what does a Pokemon Master need? Everyone needs their own Pokedex. One of the best devices out there that helps identify all those creatures you could get to see. 

In this project, we transform our phone into one of these devices taking advantage of the Pokemon API.
